# Taking an active role


Being part of the Smoke.io community means taking an active role and participating in Witness voting or unvoting.  You don't have to be a coder or DevOps Professional in order to help keep our Blockchain stable.  

***All you have to do is visit the [Witness Page](https://smoke.io/@hashkings) and vote!***

# Voting is not the only important part
<br/>
### Please Unvote!

This might be more important than voting for witnesses.  There are no term limits in this economy and its up to you to decide who stays who goes and when!  ***Your vote does matter*** and we need you to ***Unvote Disabled Witness Nodes!***

_We recommend Unvoting any nodes you have voted for which are disabled for more than ***48 hours.***_

This should give any competent system admin enough time to solve any issues with their node.  Smoke.io has many tools and guides available and there is ***No Excuse*** for someones node to be disabled for longer than 48 hours.

_Again I highly stress,_ 

### _Your [Unvote](https://smoke.io/@hashkings) is very powerful and we need you to exercise that power!_
